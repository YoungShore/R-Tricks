# improved some details of the data to make it direct practical

### needed packages ###
# install.packages("easypackages") ## <- this will help call multiple libraries in one line
# install.packages("dplyr")
# install.packages("tidyr")
# install.packages("lubridate")
# install.packages("ggplot2")
# install.packages("igraph")
# install.packages("knitr")
# x install.packages("kableExtra") ## not needed for this example, it's used by original article for demo it's programming lines, etc
# install.packages("ggrepel") ## <- this package will help keep chart texts or labels not overlap to each other

library(easypackages) #<- this is to allow libraries load multiple packs below -v
libraries("dplyr","tidyr","lubridate","ggplot2","igraph","knitr","ggrepel") # "kableExtra" 

### v-- created data for use ###

Nodes <- data.frame(
  name = c("Laurence F.","Constans G.","Caleb M.","Antero H.","Vali L.","Ivona L.","Riya S."),
  departmn = c("Leadership","Finance","Consultant","Office/Facilities Management","Leadership","Leadership","Leadership"),
  role = c("Operations","Operations","Services","Operations","Operations","Operations","Services"),
  colr = c("#F5C019","#999999","#90C432","#999999","#F5C019","#F5C019","#F5C019"),
  shap = c("circle","circle","star","circle","circle","circle","star")
) ### ^-- if colr variable is directly named as color, then the plot will use it directly for color info, and it can use simple color names, like 'red'

### superio var lists the 'boss' level, staf var lists the 'staff' level ###

Edges <- data.frame(
  superio = c("Vali L.","Ivona L.","Riya S.","Laurence F.","Laurence F.","Laurence F."),
  staf = c("Laurence F.","Constans G.","Caleb M.","Antero H.","Riya S.","Ivona L.")
) ### ^- it's important that the boss level is not missing, otherwise the final chart will miss the connecting lines 

### create graph settings ###
### note that: all names in the relation data (Edges) must also in Nodes$name variable, even only name populated but the others are missing ###

orgnet <- graph_from_data_frame(Edges,directed = TRUE, vertices = Nodes)

# summary(orgnet)

plot(orgnet)

### Adding color to the Nodes ###

V(orgnet)$color <- as.character(Nodes$colr)

### Changing the color of the links from gray to black ###

E(orgnet)$color <- "black"

### Using size parameters in the plot ###

plot(orgnet,edge.arrow.size = .5, vertex.label.color="black",vertex.label.cex=0.8,vertex.size=8)

### Use ggrepel package to avoid text/label overlaping in the chart

plot(orgnet,edge.arrow.size = .5, vertex.label.color="black",vertex.label.cex=0.8,vertex.size=8) + geom_text_repel() # or + geom_label_repel()
