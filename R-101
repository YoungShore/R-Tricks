### create a sample dataset :

x <- data.frame("SN" = 1:2, "Age" = c(21,15), "Name" = c("John","Dora")) ### this will end with SN in int type, Age in num type, Name in Factor type

### viewing a data in R studio ###

View(dst) # the 1st letter should be capitalized 

### subset a data by selecting rows ###

newDst <- dst[ which(dst$var1 != ''), ]    ### note that leave , ] blank to keep all variables

newDst <- subset(dst, vAr1 != '' & Var2 != 'bb', select=c(vAr1, Var2, vaR3)) ### note that variable names are case sensitive, too; and missing should be '', rather than ' '; and the selection of variables can use ':' to select a series of vars between 2 vars
